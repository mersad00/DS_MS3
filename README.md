Godzilla: A Cloud Key-Value storage with Replication, Failure Detection and NotiÔ¨Åcation

Key value store is at the core of many large scale distributed services. It aims to handle petabytes of data across thou- sands of servers and network components which distributed over many data centers around the world. At this scale, many components may fail continuously. In order to keep these systems functional, reliability, availability, scalability and persistent state infrastructures are required.
This report presents the design and implementation of a key value store, which is highly available and reliable in terms of persistent state. It also provides the scalability feature. To achieve scalability, a similar approach to chord implementation of DHT is used. On other hand, availability and reliability are provided using a replication strategy along side with a e cient failure detection system. Upon a failure of a node, its data is recovered using its replica servers, so persistent state is guaranteed and the probability of loss of data is very low.
